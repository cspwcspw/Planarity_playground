# Planarity Playground

This is a Windows / WPF implementation of Planarity, written in C#.

I've zipped up the executables in case you want to play the
game rather than read the code :-)   Unzip, and run the EXE file in the folder you get. 

If you just want to play planarity in your browser, I like Jason Davies' version of the game:  https://www.jasondavies.com/planarity/

Enjoy.
